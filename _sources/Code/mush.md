# Mushroom Classification Project

## Overview
The Mushroom Classification project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a mushroom is **edible** or **poisonous** based on its physical characteristics. This project demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning to a real-world classification problem.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: The dataset contains several features describing the physical characteristics of mushrooms, which are used to classify them. The key features include:
  - **Cap_diameter**: The diameter of the mushroom cap in millimeters, representing its size.
  - **Cap_shape**: A categorical value indicating the shape of the mushroom cap (e.g., bell-shaped, convex, flat).
  - **Gill_attachment**: Specifies how the gills are attached to the stem (e.g., free, attached).
  - **Gill_colour**: A categorical value representing the color of the mushroom gills.
  - **Stem_height**: The height of the mushroom stem, normalized for consistency.
  - **Stem_width**: The width of the mushroom stem in micrometers, reflecting its thickness.
  - **Stem_colour**: A categorical value indicating the stem's color.
  - **Season**: A numerical representation of the season when the mushroom was observed.
  - **Target Variable**: **Class** â€“ A binary variable indicating whether the mushroom is **edible (0)** or **poisonous (1)**.


## Tools and Technologies
- **JupyterBook**: A ipynb notebook used to create a model.  
- **FastAPI**: A application used to deploy the model.  
- **Streamlit**: A Python library for creating interactive web applications quickly and easily.  
- **Docker**: A platform for containerizing applications to ensure consistency and portability.  
- **DigitalOcean**: A cloud hosting platform for deploying and scaling applications.  
.


## Project Highlights
- **Accurate Classification**: The model was trained and evaluated for high accuracy and reliability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Streamlit app provides a clean and simple interface for users to interact with the model.
- **Educational Value**: This project serves as a demonstration of machine learning's application in a biological context.
